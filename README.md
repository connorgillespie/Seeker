# Seeker
## About
Seeker was designed to help users find files with ease. After constantly losing files, I finally decided to create a simple, efficent script to help releviate the issue.

## Requirements
This script works out of the box on any system with Python 3 installed.

## Inputs
### File
The file input is used to find any file by an extension or filename. 

For example, if you were wishing to search for the file test.txt, you would enter the following.
> test.txt

The ASCII character * can be replaced within the input to symbolize a wildcard. A wildcard can be used to subsitute for zero or more characters within a string.

For example, if you are trying to display all .txt files within a directory, you would enter the following.
> *.txt
